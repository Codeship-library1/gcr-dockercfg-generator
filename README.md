# Dockercfg Generation Service for Google Cloud GCR

This repository is deprecated. The code was moved to the GitHub repository at [codeship-library/google-cloud-deployment](https://github.com/codeship-library/google-cloud-deployment/).

The generated Docker image stays available on Docker Hub at [codeship/gcr-dockercfg-generator](https://hub.docker.com/r/codeship/gcr-dockercfg-generator/), so there is no need to update your projects.
